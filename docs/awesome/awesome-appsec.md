Running a business requires being cost-conscious and minimizing unnecessary spending. The benefits of ensuring in the security of your application are invisible to most companies, so often times they neglect to invest in secure software development as a cost-saving measure. What these companies don't realize is the potential cost (https://github.com/paragonie/awesome-appsec/blob/master/both financial and to brand reputation) a preventable data compromise can incur.

**The average data breach costs millions of dollars in damage.**

Investing more time and personnel to develop secure software is, for most companies, worth it to minimize this unnecessary risk to their bottom line.
